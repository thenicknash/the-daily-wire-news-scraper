# The Daily Wire News Scraper

The Daily Wire News Scraper is a simple terminal app that uses Python's Beautiful Soup to scrape the Daily Wire news site in order to:

* See the current top headlines
* See other headlines and stories across the site
* Read an individual article (via URL)

Now, you might ask, "Why shouldn't I just go to the Daily Wire website to read the news?" Great question! If all you want to do is read news, I would head on over to the [Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com) website; however, what is currently described for the project is only a humble beginning. The ultimate goal of this terminal application is to eventually programmatically rank the news outlet (and more outlets in the future) in terms of credibility, bias, and prestige.
